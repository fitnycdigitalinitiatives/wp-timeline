== Description ==

Wordpress theme built for the Museum at FIT's Exhibition Timeline site. This theme was built off of the WP-Bootstrap Starter theme (https://afterimagedesigns.com/wp-bootstrap-starter/) and inspired by Curator by theMOLITOR (http://themolitor.com/help/curator). This theme is specifically designed for use by the Museum at FIT, but with some minor modifications could be repurposed for other organizations.
